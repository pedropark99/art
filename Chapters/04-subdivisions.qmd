# Introducing Recursive Subdivisions {#sec-subdivisions}

You might get surprise by how much of generative art
comes from taking an initial shape, and subdividing it
in multiple parts. Creating like a sequence of 
shape segments.

Examples of this are the [series *Fidenza* by Tyle Hobbs](https://tylerxhobbs.com/fidenza)[^t1],
or [*Subdivision* by Danielle Navarro](https://art.djnavarro.net/gallery/subdivision/)[^dna1],
or [the collection *Archetype* by by Kjetil Golid](https://www.artblocks.io/collections/curated/projects/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/23)[^hje1].
